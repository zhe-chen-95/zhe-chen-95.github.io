## News 

* I am entering my final year of Ph.D. program and am on the job market (2022 Fall - 2023 Spring).
* I moved my office to WWH 1030, Courant, NYU, wellcome to stop by!

## About
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Mathematics at the [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/), [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/), supervised by [Professor Charles S. Peskin](https://www.math.nyu.edu/~peskin/). I specialize in the area of Applied and Computational Mathematics. I am a Henry M. MacCracken Fellowship from 2018 to 2023. Prior to my Ph.D. at NYU, I graduated from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) with a B.S. in Mathematics (with Honors) and a B.S. in Physics (double major), where I was part of [Professor Pingwen Zhang](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/pzhang/en/)'s research group.
